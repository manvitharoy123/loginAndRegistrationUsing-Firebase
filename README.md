# loginAndRegistrationUsing-Firebase
This is a login and register with email authentication using firebase. This is an app which is made in android studio where i have created two xml files(one for registering ,one for login). after user enters the details those will be entered in firebase database and when the same user logs in again the user credentials are verified using firebase . after registering the user is redirected to main welcome page same in the case of login.
